    % inputs
        %featureColumn: all the data rows for some given feature of the
        %'bank-full.csv' data e.g. age, job, marital status...
        %labels: the labels for the same data set above. Each row corresponds to featureColumn's rows. 
    % Output
        %Bucketholder: a cell array that is structured like [{table1}, {table2}, ...,{tablen}]
        % where each {table} is a subset of featureColumn and labels where
        % all the elements of the {table} are data points such that they
        % have the same feature value. e.g say the feature data passed in
        % was 'marital status' which has the four possible values 'single',
        % 'married', 'divorced' and 'unknown'; the data structure would
        % look like [{single table}, {married table}, {divorced table}, {unknown table}]
    % Why?
        %we need data grouped like this to do the calculation for
        %'information gain' which helps us pick the best attribute to split
        %on at each node
            %information gain = entropy(parent) - [average entropy(children)]
